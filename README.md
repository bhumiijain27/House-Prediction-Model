# early-disease-prediction
Machine learning project to predict heart disease using health indicators. 
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including heart disease, are the leading cause of death
worldwide. Early detection of heart disease is critical for preventing serious health outcomes
and improving the quality of life for patients. With the increasing availability of medical data,
machine learning models can be used to predict whether a patient is likely to develop heart
disease based on certain health indicators.
In this project, you will build a classification model to predict whether an individual is likely to
have heart disease or not. The dataset provided includes various health and demographic
factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking
and alcohol consumption). The goal is to train a model to identify which individuals have
heart disease based on these features.
